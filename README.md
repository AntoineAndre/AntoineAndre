### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am Antoine AndrÃ©, a third year PhD student working on nano positioning by vision at the FEMTO-ST Institute.

### ðŸ”¬ Research

My current research focuses on the pose measurement with nanometric resolution of periodic patterns with the help of computer vision. Developped tool to achieve this is available as a precompiled `.dll` [here](https://projects.femto-st.fr/vernier/en).

Preprint of already published papers are available here:

- [Sensing One Nanometer over Ten Centimeters: A Micro-Encoded Target for Visual In-Plane Position Measurement](https://antoineandre.github.io/category/tmech_hal.pdf)
- [Robust phase-based decoding for absolute (X,Y,Î˜) positioning by vision](https://antoineandre.github.io/category/TIM_HAL.pdf)
- [Robust, precise and scalable: A phase-encoded pattern for visual X, Y, $\theta$ positioning](https://antoineandre.github.io/category/MARSS_full_paper_ANDRE_HAL.pdf)

### ðŸ“š Teaching

Currently giving practical courses at ENSMM (BesanÃ§on) to 3rd year engineer students. Aborded topics are highly linked to computer vision such as:

- Camera calibration
- 2 cameras homography (see github repo aruco_video_homography)
- 3D reconstruction from 2 cameras
- 3D triangulation

I also had the opportunity to give practical courses on microcontrollers (PIC16F) to second year students.

### ðŸŽ“ Background

- ENSMM (Franche-comtÃ©, France) engineer diploma, specialization on mechatronics and robotics
- Double diploma with the Franche-ComtÃ© University in micro robotics
- 7 months long internship at the Tokyo Denki University (Tokyo, Japan) focusing on control of biomechanical hand.
