### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am Antoine AndrÃ©, a Postdoctoral researcher in Computer Vision at the [JRL CNRS-AIST](https://unit.aist.go.jp/jrl-22022/index_en.html) laboratory of research.

### ðŸ”¬ Research

**Post-doc**

My current research focuses on __visual servoing with great precision and large convergence domain__. To do this, __omnidirectional cameras__ are taken in account, since they can provide a full 360 degrees representation of the scene. This representation allows to work with a spherical representation of the images, providing a better understanding of the scene.

These post-doctoral researches started in Amiens, in the [MIS](https://www.mis.u-picardie.fr/) laboratory of research, in the PR team (Robotics perception).

More details can be found in the 2022 CVPR conference paper : [Photometric Visual Gyroscope for Full-View Spherical Camera](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022W/OmniCV/papers/Andre_Photometric_Visual_Gyroscope_for_Full-View_Spherical_Camera_CVPRW_2022_paper.pdf)

**Ph.D.**

My previous research was focusing on the __pose measurement with nanometric resolution__ of periodic patterns with the help of __microscopy computer vision__. Developped tool to achieve this is available as a precompiled `.dll` [here](https://projects.femto-st.fr/vernier/en).

More details about the process of high resolution pose measurement can be found on [my website](https://antoineandre.github.io/)

An **open source version** of this pose measurement method is available for the 1D case with matlab in [this repository](https://github.com/AntoineAndre/1D_phase_measurement)

Preprint of already published papers are available here:

The manuscript of the thesis is available [here](https://github.com/AntoineAndre/PhD_manuscript) (in french).

### ðŸ“š Teaching

I gave practical courses for 3 years at ENSMM (BesanÃ§on) to 3rd year engineer students (M2 students). Aborded topics were highly linked to computer vision such as:

- Camera calibration
- 2 cameras homography (see github repo aruco_video_homography)
- 3D reconstruction from 2 cameras
- 3D triangulation

I also had the opportunity to give practical courses on microcontrollers (PIC16F) to second year students.

### ðŸŽ“ Background

- __Engineer degree at ENSMM__ (National Superior School of Mechanics and Microtechnics), __robotics and mechatronics__ specialization.
- Microsystems, Instrumentation and Robotics __Master double degree__ at University of Franche-ComtÃ©, BesanÃ§on.
- 6 months long __internship at the Tokyo Denki University__ (Tokyo, Japan) working on compliant command based on Serial Elastic Actuators for prostethics hands.
